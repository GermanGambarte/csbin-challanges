      <h1>JS The Easier Parts - Variables, Data Types, and Control Flow</h1>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 1</h3>

        Replace the blank underscores inside the console logs with the data type
        (i.e. 'string') you think each value will be. (Leave the quotes)
        <br />
        Ex.
        <br />
        <pre>
var myStr = "hello"
  console.log(typeof myStr === "string") //=&gt; true</pre
        >
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 2</h3>

        Create a functon
        <code>buildSentence</code> that takes three words (strings) and adds
        them together and console.logs the whole sentence (string) complete with
        capitalization and punctuation.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 3</h3>

        Create a function
        <code>lastLetter</code> that takes a word (string) and console.logs the
        last character/letter of that word. <br />
        Hint: Remember that each character/letter in a string has an index
        position that you can access with brackets: []
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 4</h3>

        Create a function
        <code>buildGreeting</code> that takes a time (integer) and a name
        (string) and print a greeting based on the following rules:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            If time is between 0 (inclusive) and 11 (inclusive): "Good Morning,
            &lt;<em>name</em>&gt;!
          </li>
          <li>
            If time is between 12 (inclusive) and 16 (inclusive): "Good
            Afternoon, &lt;<em>name</em>&gt;!
          </li>
          <li>
            If time is between 17 (inclusive) and 23 (inclusive): "Good Evening,
            &lt;<em>name</em>&gt;!
          </li>
          <li>
            If time is anything else: "That's not a real time,
            &lt;<em>name</em>&gt;. Maybe you need some sleep!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 5</h3>

        <code>indexOf</code> is a function that you can call on a string
        (string1) and accepts another string (string2) as an argument. <br />
        It searches through string1 from left to right checking each character
        to see if it can find string2. <br />
        If it finds string2 it returns the index position of the FIRST character
        that matches string2. If it cannot find string2 it returns negative one:
        -1. <br />
        Enter the index position you think indexOf will return for each below.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 6</h3>

        Create a function
        <code>letterExists</code> that takes a word (string) and a character
        (string), and console.logs whether that letter can be found inside that
        word.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 7</h3>

        Create a function <code>isPrime</code> that console.logs a boolean
        indicating if `number` is prime or not.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 8</h3>

        Create a function <code>range</code> that console.logs all numbers
        between 'start' and 'end' in sequential order.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 9</h3>

        Create a function <code>myIndexOf</code> that takes an array and an
        element and console.logs the index of the element in the array, or -1 if
        it doesn't exist.
        <br />
        Assume the `ele` will be a primitive data type (no arrays or objects).
        <br />
        DO NOT USE THE BUILT-IN `indexOf` METHOD IN YOUR SOLUTION!
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 10</h3>

        Create a function <code>unique</code> that console.logs an array where
        all the duplicates of the input array have been removed; in other words,
        every element remaining is unique.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 11</h3>

        Create a function <code>longestWord</code> that that retuns the longest
        word of a sentence. <br />If there are ties, the function should return
        the later word.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 12</h3>

        Create a function <code>disemvowel</code> that takes in a string and
        returns a string with all vowels removed.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 13</h3>

        Create a function <code>divisibleByFivePairSum</code> that takes an
        array of numbers. <br />It should return an array of all the pairs of
        indices whose sum is a multiple of five.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 14</h3>

        Create a function <code>highestScore</code> that takes in an array of
        student objects as a parameter.
        <br />
        <br />It should return a string that corresponds to the student with the
        highest score.
        <br />
        <br />The string should contain that student's initials concatenated
        with their id.
        <br />
        <br />Assume the array contains at least 1 student object and the
        student with the highest score is unique (there are no ties).
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Challenge 15</h3>

        Create a function <code>leastCommonMultiple</code> that takes two
        numbers (integers) as input and returns the lowest number which is a
        multiple of both inputs.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Extension 1</h3>

        Create a function <code>arrayBuilder</code> that takes in a count object
        and returns an array filled with the appropriate numbers of elements.
        The order of the elements in the array does not matter, but repeated
        elements should be grouped.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Extension 2</h3>

        Create a function <code>objectBuilder</code> that takes in a number and
        returns an object whose keys are 0 up to number and the values are that
        same number multipled by 5.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Extension 3</h3>

        Create a function <code>secretCipher</code> that takes in an
        string(sentence) and an object(cipher). Return a string where every
        character is replaced with its cooresponding value in the cipher. If the
        character doesn't exist in the cipher, use the original character.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Extension 4</h3>

        Create a function <code>passingStudents</code> that accepts an array of
        student objects. <br />It should iterate through the list of students
        and return an array of the names of all the students who have an average
        grade of at least 70.
